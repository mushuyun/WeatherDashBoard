**Use api call to get weather information**

This app is using api call to https://openweathermap.org/appid to track weather by city. It will provide the current weather information such as temperature, wind, humidity and uvindex if you enter a city name. Apart from that, it will also show 5 day forcast for the city you entered. By default, when the page first loaded, it will show the current weather for my city - Morrisville. 

There are three api calls are made, one is using city name as paramiter to get general wether information and that specific city's latitude and longitue. Then the latitude and longitude data obtained from the prior call are used as parameter to track UV Index and fectch 5 day forcast.

For your convenience, I've taken some screen shots to give you a rough idea about the interface.
